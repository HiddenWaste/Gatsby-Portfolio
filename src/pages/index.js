          Here I have my projects showcased as my portfolio, and a blog page where I make posts ranging from
          the music I am listening to, books I'm reading, or computer science / AI related stuff!

          <br /><br />

          This website has been one of my major passion projects for a while. I didn't take any web development courses
          in college so I have learned all these technologies on my own time. I've found a real enjoyment in it and plan
          to continually improve and update this site.

          <br></br>

          The projects showcased here are a combination of many different things but ultimately all point towards what I
          enjoy doing: creating new venues and tools for artistic expression. I find both P.A.C.E and F-E-R-M are the main
          showcases of this ideology. I use Ferm quite often myself as its simply fun to use! Which was one of the major reasons
          I had worked so long on it and made so many different capabilites.

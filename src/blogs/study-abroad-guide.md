APPLY APPLY APPLY

During this entire process applying should be to apply to as much as you can. I've worked on creating this resource to streamline the process of finding scholarships a bit more so you don't have to waste so much time figuring it all out!

## Scholarship Aggregators
Scholarship Aggregators are going to be one of your greatest friends. They essentially have databases of a bunch of scholarships for you to go through and apply to!

### Services (Be somewhat wary of these?)
[Bold](https://bold.org/)
[ScholarshipOwl](https://scholarshipowl.com/)
[FastWeb](https://www.fastweb.com/)

I will say that some of these seem quite....scammy. Request a ton of your information, no real way to ensure they are real, and just a very gamified/commercialized take on searching for scholarships. I did end up paying for scholarship owl, not sure how much value I got back out of it. Either way, creating accounts for these websites will bring many, many scholarships directly to you to apply to. But not all of them!

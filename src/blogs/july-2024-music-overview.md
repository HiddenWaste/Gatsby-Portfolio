# Intro

This is hopefully the first of (at least a few) blogs in which I showcase my Spotify playlist of music for the month and talk about it a bit! First off, with an embed of my playlist:

This month I ended up pushing forward a bit in R&B. Musica espanol, Ari Lennox, and of course Omar Apollo are probably the most listened to bits.

# Newly Released Albums

## Liana Flores - Flower of the Soul (June 28th)
Felt like I had to include Liana Flores and Omar Apollo as they were very close to June at least, and I haven't been able to talk about either album all too much.

### Berlioz - Open this Wall
I had been waiting for Berlioz's album to release as I could tell they were releasing singles like there was an upcoming album. I hadn't any idea when it would drop so I was surprised when it did! A great blend of jazz/electronic/dance that is like Nujabes but from Europe. This album just solidified this sort of formula for me and the general sound that Berlioz cultivates on the record. My favorite track is 'something will happen'.

### Childish Gambino - Bando Stone and the New World
Bando Stone and the New World was another I was very excited for, and he somewhat delivered! Most of the album is pretty okay in my opinion, but Lithonia + the last 4-5 songs on the album are GREAT. Definitely will keep playing at least a couple of the tracks for a while

### Omar Apollo - God Said No (June 28th)
Finally, the album I was the most excited for: God Said No. I've become a huge Omar Apollo fan this last year, becoming very familiar with his discography and sound. God Said No is a refinement of some of his newer sounds combined with quite a bit of breakup songs. With where I was at personally at it's release the album felt like it directly reflected some of what I was feeling and going through. Done With You, Drifting, Life's Unfair, Against Me, and Dispose of me all hit very close to home. Felt very validating, and also led me to some truths I needed to start internalizing to heal. 


# General Music Listening
- R&B - Ari Lennox, Misc R&B, etc
- Spanish Music
- Drain Gang Revisit

Went on another huge R&B kick this month that led to me making a Misc R&B playlist like my Misc Rap playlist which consolidated my R&B I listen to into one playlist again. Ari Lennox is one of my favorite R&B artists right now. Blackberry Sap, 40 shades of Choke, Pressure, GOAT, and so many more are some of my go-to's.

For a good few days straight all I listened to was Spanish music. My favs I found and dived a bit into are Los Panchos, Eydie Gorme, Selena, Carolina Sarta, and some generals I added to my spanish R&B playlist I already had.

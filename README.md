# Welcome to my Gatsby Site GitHub Page!!

This site is something I have been wanting to work toward for quite a while and finally have progress! The final outcome I hope for is a site that is very multi-faceted. Hopefully serving as my portfolio/resume/blog/web app testing playground all in one!

Currently very simplistic with my major achievement being the reading of markdown files for blogs as I will write almost any blog/essay in Obsidian.

Currently Working On:
  - Look and feel of overall site
  - Daily Markdown Note Generation
  - Learning Tone.js and Web Audio API
